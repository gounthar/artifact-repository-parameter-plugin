<div>
    Define a regex to match any of the entries.
    <br/><br/>
    <p>
        Please note that when a regex matches multiple entries but the display style is set to either
        radio button or dropdown then only the first match wins as those types do not allow for
        multiple entries to be selected. Furthermore, the regex is always checked against the full path
        and not just the displayed value.

        Example: <br/>
        <br/>
        Displayed Value: <code>artifact-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar</code>
        <br/>
        Full Path: <code>http://localhost:8081/foo/bar/com.example.group/artifact/artifact-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar</code>
