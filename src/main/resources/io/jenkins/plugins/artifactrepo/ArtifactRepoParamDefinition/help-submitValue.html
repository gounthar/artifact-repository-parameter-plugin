        By default the plugin will not only submit the label but also some hidden value containing
        the path of the item represented by the label. Sometimes however one only wants to get the
        value visible in the label. This option will allow you to choose what information will get
        passed along to the build script.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Label + Path (default) - This will send both the label and the hidden path to the build
            pipeline. Both information are split by a ; (semi-colon).</li>
        <li>Label Only - This will only send the visible label text to the build pipeline.</li>
        <li>Path Only - This will only send a non-visible path of the artifact/repository to the
            build pipeline.</li>
    </ul>
